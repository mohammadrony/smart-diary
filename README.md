A developing project on flutter for students daily task management. In this project I'm using [getx](https://pub.dev/packages/get) package for state management, dependency injection and all those feature comes with it. [getx pattern](https://github.com/kauemurakami/getx_pattern) for the folder structure format. Also using [sqlite database](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) for the local storage.
